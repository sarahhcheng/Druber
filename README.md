# Druber - UBC Launch Pad Technical Challenge

## Frontend Problem Description
You and your friends are developing a new start-up called DRUBER, a drone-based ride share application that carries you to your destination. The original specification was to develop a web page that works in 1920x1080 however your company has realized that it is missing an entire market of smartphone users. Describe how you can modify your code to work in smartphone resolutions e.g. 750x1334 (iPhone 8). Please give specific examples where possible, but do not implement an entire DRUBER clone!

## Diving into the Problem
Let's dive into creating a web page that looks great for desktop users.

It seems like the positioning of the elements were suitable for desktop display but not for mobile display. So how can we fix the issue so that it looks good for both?

## Solution
I implemented the following code below:
